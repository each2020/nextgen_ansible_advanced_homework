1. Provision the Ansible Advanced - Homework and Ansible Advanced NG - OpenStack lab environments

2. Connect to Red Hat Ansible Tower Hamework Lab Environment

- Connect to the control host from your laptop

  [laptop ]$ ssh <user-id>@control.<guid>.example.opentlc.com
  password: <Enter password as provided>
  [user@control ~]$ sudo -i
  [root@control ~]#

3. Set Up Control host

Clone the  https://github.com/each2020/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework.git

4. From the cloned repo copy labrc file in your home dir and edit to setup env variables which we will be using in the whole lab

[root@control ~]# git clone https://github.com/<github handler>/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework.git
[root@control ~]# cd nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework
[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# cp labrc ~/
[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# cat ~/labrc
export TOWER_GUID=<Tower env GUID>
export OSP_GUID=<OSP Env GUID>
export OSP_DOMAIN=<OSP Env domain name>
export OPENTLC_ID=<username-example.com>
export MAIL_ID=<username@example.com>
export OPENTLC_PASSWORD=<Your OPENTLC Password>
export GITHUB_REPO=https://github.com/<github username>/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework.git
export JQ_REPO_BASE=http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp
export REGION=us-east-1

5. Set the env variable from ~/labrc file.
[root@control ~]# source ~/labrc

6. From the cloned repository, run the site-setup-prereqs.yaml playbook to provision the network, flavor, security groups, and SSH keys

7. Verify a successful connection between the control and workstation hosts using the openstack.pem key

[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# ssh -i /root/.ssh/openstack.pem cloud-user@workstation-${OSP_GUID}.${OSP_DOMAIN}

9. From your web browser, connect to tower1.${TOWER_GUID}.example.opentlc.com to verify that the isolated node is operational, using admin for the username and password As provided in email

10. Navigate to Instance Groups from the side panel and select osp

In the left Menu go to Instance Groups --> osp --> instances

Verify workstation entry is there

11.Update Ansible Tower WebUI admin password.

Reset r3dh4t1! as admin password after sign-in using password provided in email.

12. Update Ansible Tower admin password in tower-cli config.

[root@control ~]# cat ~/.tower_cli.cfg
[general]
host = tower1.<guid>.internal
username = admin
password = r3dh4t1!
verify_ssl = False

13. From the cloned repository, run the site-config-tower.yml playbook to create the job templates and workflow template:

[root@control ~]# source ~/labrc
[root@control ~]# cd nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework
[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# ansible-playbook site-config-tower.yml -e tower_GUID=${TOWER_GUID} -e osp_GUID=${OSP_GUID} -e osp_DOMAIN=${OSP_DOMAIN} -e opentlc_login=${OPENTLC_ID} -e path_to_opentlc_key=/root/.ssh/mykey.pem -e param_repo_base=${JQ_REPO_BASE} -e opentlc_password=${OPENTLC_PASSWORD} -e REGION_NAME=${REGION} -e EMAIL=${MAIL_ID} -e github_repo=${GITHUB_REPO}

14. Provision Production Environment

Perform the following steps to retrieve and prepare requisite scripts that provision the production environment on the control node:

[root@control ~]# mkdir ~/bin
[root@control ~]# wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/common.sh
[root@control ~]# wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/jq-linux64 -O ~/bin/jq
[root@control ~]# wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/order_svc.sh
[root@control ~]# chmod +x order_svc.sh ~/bin/jq common.sh 

Set up credentials and execute the shell script to deploy the production environment from the control host:

[root@control ~]# cat << EOF > credential.rc
export username=<userid-companyname.com>
export password=<opentlc account password>
export uri=https://labs.opentlc.com
EOF

[root@control ~]# source credential.rc ; ./order_svc.sh -y -c 'OPENTLC Automation' -i 'Ansible Advanced - Three Tier App' -t 1 -d 'dialog_expiration=7;region=na;nodes=1;dialog_runtime=8;notes=Training - As part of course' 

15. In Ansible Tower UI, go to Templates and select Opentlc Key to edit it.

In USERNAME field, update the user name to ec2-user

In SSH Private Key field, replace the key with the contents from GUIDkey.pem taken from Three Tier App bastion host.

15. Execute the cidr workflow template from the Ansible Tower UI, which must be able to run successfully according to these requirements:

Provision instances in the OpenStack QA environment

Deploy the application in the QA environment

Run the smoke test to verify the application

Clean up if the test fails

Provision instances on AWS using order_svc.sh script for the production environment

Deploy the application in the production environment

Run the smoke test to verify the application
