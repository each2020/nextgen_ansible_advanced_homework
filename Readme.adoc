[root@control ~]# git clone https://github.com/<github handler>/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework.git
[root@control ~]# cd nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework
[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# cp labrc ~/
[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# cat ~/labrc
export TOWER_GUID=<Tower env GUID>
export OSP_GUID=<OSP Env GUID>
export OSP_DOMAIN=<OSP Env domain name>
export OPENTLC_ID=<username-example.com>
export MAIL_ID=<username@example.com>

export GITHUB_REPO=https://github.com/<github username>/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework.git
export JQ_REPO_BASE=http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp
export REGION=us-east-1

5. Set the env variable from ~/labrc file.
[root@control ~]# source ~/labrc

6. From the cloned repository, run the site-setup-prereqs.yaml playbook to provision the network, flavor, security groups, and SSH keys

7. Verify a successful connection between the control and workstation hosts using the openstack.pem key

[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# ssh -i /root/.ssh/openstack.pem cloud-user@workstation-${OSP_GUID}.${OSP_DOMAIN}

9. From your web browser, connect to tower1.${TOWER_GUID}.example.opentlc.com to verify that the isolated node is operational, using admin for the username and password As provided in email

10. Navigate to Instance Groups from the side panel and select osp

[root@control ~]# cat ~/.tower_cli.cfg
[general]
host = tower1.<guid>.internal
username = admin
password = r3dh4t1!
verify_ssl = False

13. From the cloned repository, run the site-config-tower.yml playbook to create the job templates and workflow template:

[root@control ~]# source ~/labrc
[root@control ~]# cd nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework
[root@control ~/nextgen_ansible_advanced_homework]# ansible-playbook site-config-tower.yml -e tower_GUID=${TOWER_GUID} -e osp_GUID=${OSP_GUID} -e osp_DOMAIN=${OSP_DOMAIN} -e opentlc_login=${OPENTLC_ID} -e path_to_opentlc_key=/root/.ssh/mykey.pem -e param_repo_base=${JQ_REPO_BASE} -e opentlc_password=${OPENTLC_PASSWORD} -e REGION_NAME=${REGION} -e EMAIL=${MAIL_ID} -e github_repo=${GITHUB_REPO}
